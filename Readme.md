# Project Ideas



# Idea-1:
**Recommendation System Chatbot for Master’s Application process**

Every master’s student goes through the tiring  phase of shortlisting universities for his applications . We depend on factors like previous admits/rejects profiles , rankings of the universities ,  accept/reject ratio of the department and university we are applying . Doing this manually for every university is time consuming and can be somewhat tricky. 
So , our idea is to build a recommendation platform that uses Machine learning and recommends universities, predicts accept/reject chances of a student based on his/her profile . We will build a chatbot that interacts and resolves the queries for the applicants making their application process a lot smoother.

# Idea-2:
**K8s Monitoring and Handling tool**

The default way to handle and monitor different k8s clusters is through CLI. It makes it difficult to monitor multiple aspects of the cluster at once, in a continuous way.
We plan to create a UI based monitoring tool, where users will be able to monitor the resources (application resources/ cluster resources) through UI, and also handle it. Also keep a log of the necessary monitoring outcomes.


# Idea-3:
**Fake News Detection using NLP**

Due to low cost, easy access, and rapid dissemination of information, social media has taken a central role as a news source for people than a traditional news organization. A freely available tool is needed to check the authenticity of the news before it reaches the public to prevent spreading false information. Our aim is to develop a reliable model that classifies a given news article as either fake or true. Our model will use ML and NLP techniques to identify untrustworthy news sources. Once we identify a source as a producer of fake news, there is a high probability that any future articles from that source will also be fake.

Category: Immigration**

Day to day it's becoming very difficult for immigrants to follow the new rules related to immigration  that are being changed. They have no idea about their chance of visa extension status, odds of being denied and impact of IT industry if the US overrides rules. We would like to use machine learning and create a dashboard which answers all the frequently asked questions so that immigrants can benefit by looking at all the things needed at one place rather than searching different websites.
