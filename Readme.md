# Project Ideas



# Idea-1:
**Recommendation System Chatbot for Master’s Application process**

Every master’s student goes through the tiring  phase of shortlisting universities for his applications . We depend on factors like previous admits/rejects profiles , rankings of the universities ,  accept/reject ratio of the department and university we are applying . Doing this manually for every university is time consuming and can be somewhat tricky. 
So , our idea is to build a recommendation platform that uses Machine learning and recommends universities, predicts accept/reject chances of a student based on his/her profile . We will build a chatbot that interacts and resolves the queries for the applicants making their application process a lot smoother.

# Idea-2:
**K8s Monitoring and Handling tool**

The default way to handle and monitor different k8s clusters is through CLI. It makes it difficult to monitor multiple aspects of the cluster at once, in a continuous way.
We plan to create a UI based monitoring tool, where users will be able to monitor the resources (application resources/ cluster resources) through UI, and also handle it. Also keep a log of the necessary monitoring outcomes.


# Idea-3:
**Fake News Detection using NLP**

Due to low cost, easy access, and rapid dissemination of information, social media has taken a central role as a news source for people than a traditional news organization. A freely available tool is needed to check the authenticity of the news before it reaches the public to prevent spreading false information. Our aim is to develop a reliable model that classifies a given news article as either fake or true. Our model will use ML and NLP techniques to identify untrustworthy news sources. Once we identify a source as a producer of fake news, there is a high probability that any future articles from that source will also be fake.
